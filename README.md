# Catalyst-Script-Task
To insert contents of a CSV file into a MySQL database using PHP...

user_upload_v1.php: This script just tries to open the CSV file and outputs a message if successful.

user_upload_v2.php: This script creates "users" table in the "company" database.

user_upload_v3.php: This script opens "users.csv" file and prints all of its contents on the screen.

user_upload_v4.php:This version trims contents of the filds, capitalises first letters of name & surname fields, lowercases email field. It removes the header row(as it has been mentioned in Issue#1), and also validates email addresses.
